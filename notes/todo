TODO

- Notes on current performance
    - new command seems kinda useless I always just end up running new and
      applied back to back, maybe let you select between working and applied?

- For db stuff
    - Make it so that the date field of the database is timezone aware
    - Make the database store resumes and files so that you can clean up
      applied and rejected applications

- Switch to menu package instead of fzf

- Add selection for resume templates

- Include Makefiles for personal implementation

- Include logic to not include files like Makefiles and DS_Store

- Figure out how to have template folder actually found from any location

- Make it so that you select a project directory or configure one so that the
  application doesn't have to be one place for it to work
- A command line tool should work from any directory not just the one you want
  to store your files
    - Add functionality that allows config on first run so the folders and db
      wont just be copied into every directory

- Refactor tests
    - rename tests to have better titles
    - Learn how to use faker package for runnings parameterized test data
    - Add fzf tests for applied and rejected cases
    - Parameterize all tests

- Refactor code
    - Add a way to config directories, maybe read from a config file
    - Have the database in an application directory instead of the working
      directory to feel more professional
    - Figure out a pleasant way for a user to locate the folders instead of
      just in the folder they install it in

Done
- Add install instructions in README

- Fix build system
    - Figure out how to properly disribute project with dependancies (oh wait
      just maybe dont and have them pip install -r req.txt)
    - Figure out how modules fucking work
- Trim trailing whitespace from inputs or else it gets replaced by an _

- Add docstrings or comments
- Update usage messages

- Update README.md
    - Explain dependancy on fzf
    - Explain shortcuts to commands

- test if fzf is installed on their machine so you can have helpful error
  message instead of a crash
